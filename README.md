# DiffESM
Using diffusion to approximate Earth System Model (ESM) in the temperature and precipitation sphere. Generative modeling of this kind can be used for identification of future climate anomalies such as heat waves or dry spells.

## Setup Instructions

1. We use weights and biases for logging. To use it, you will need to make an account: [https://wandb.ai/site](https://wandb.ai/site)

2. To set up your environment using Conda, follow these steps:

   b. Clone the repository to your local machine:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
      cd your-repo-name
      ```

   c. Create a Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file provided in the repository:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      ```

   d. Activate the newly created environment:
      ```bash
      conda activate diffesm
      ```

   e. After activating the environment, you can proceed with the rest of the setup.
